About
This code is part of a full website whose main task is to vote for favorite artist displayed on the website. Currently, the website uses html, css and javascript to bring two main functionalities
1. Full search engine- user is able to search for favorite artist name in the search bar. The website will filter from the data in the json file and bring the artist name with all their details
2. Active Click Button- The user can vote for their favorite artist by clicking the button
3. Once the voteButton is clicked, it returns a new button called voted
4. The voted button turns blue to indicate that one has voted
5. The contact us and about section when clicked redirects one to the bottom of the page. They have same ID as elements in navBar
6. There is a footer section with the copyright (always use &copy)
7. 

Remaining Task -Back End of the Website
1. Back end where the user can log in to the system - This will ensure that a user once voted and the page reloads, there status as voted or not voted remains
2. There will be need for database where the system will store the data and once clicked, the voting button will be disabled to prevent the user from voting again
